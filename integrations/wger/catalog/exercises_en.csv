<p>Lift bar by extending hips and knees to full extension. Pull shoulders back at top of lift if rounded. Return weights to floor by bending hips back while allowing knees to bend forward, keeping back straight and knees pointed same direction as feet. Repeat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip. Lever barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier loading and unloading of weight plates.</p>

<p>The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.</p>
<p>When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.</p>
<p>A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body.

To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.

Unlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."
1113,bd141adb-b9ad-4038-b11f-1db8665f72bc,Push-Ups | Parallettes,Chest,,Chest,Shoulders; Triceps,CC-BY-SA 4,"Parallettes push-ups are a variation of the traditional push-up that are performed with the hands on parallel bars, known as parallettes. To perform a parallettes push-up, assume a push-up position with your hands on the parallettes and your feet on the ground. Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.

Parallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.

The added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

Starting Position: Hang with arms fully extended, engaging your core and keeping your shoulder blades pulled down.3. The Pull: Pull your body up towards one hand, similar to a regular pull-up. At the same time, extend the other arm out to the side, keeping it as straight as possible. Your chin should come towards the hand that is pulling.4. Hold &amp; Lower: Briefly hold the top position where one arm is bent and pulling, and the other is extended. Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position with control.5. Alternate: Repeat the movement, pulling up towards the opposite hand.The key to this exercise is to keep the assisting arm as straight as possible to maximise the load on the working arm. This makes it a challenging but effective exercise for unilateral pulling strength."

It offers multiple benefits, such as the ability to easily adjust speed and incline, allowing for a variety of workouts, from hill walking to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and tempo runs. To optimize results, it's important to vary your workouts.

Benefits of Treadmill Cardio:
- Improved Cardiovascular Health:
Regular aerobic exercise on a treadmill strengthens the heart and lungs, which can help prevent heart disease.
- Weight Loss:
By burning calories, treadmill training can be an effective tool for weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight.
- Muscle Strengthening:
It strengthens the muscles in the legs and glutes, helping to prevent muscle loss, which is especially important with age.
- Training Flexibility:
Allows you to vary speed, incline, and intervals, making your workout more dynamic and adaptable to different fitness levels.

Types of Treadmill Training:
- Hill Walking:
Increasing the incline of the treadmill and walking at a brisk pace can improve endurance and work your leg muscles.
- Endurance Jog:
A run at a comfortable, steady pace that keeps your heart rate in a target zone (such as Zone 2) to build endurance.
- Interval Training:
Alternating periods of high intensity (fast running) with periods of low intensity (easy walking or jogging) to maximize calorie burn and cardiovascular improvement.
- Tempo Run:
A run at a steady, sustained pace that is slightly faster than a normal jog, which challenges your ability to sustain a more intense effort for an extended period."
