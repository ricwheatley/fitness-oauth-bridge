This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.</p>\n<p>When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.</p>\n<p>A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.</p>"

When done on a rowing machine, rowing also exercises muscles that extend and support the legs (quadriceps and thigh muscles). In all cases, the abdominal and lower back muscles must be used in order to support the body and prevent back injury."

The lifter stands erect, hands about shoulder width apart, and raises the shoulders as high as possible, and then lowers them, while not bending the elbows, or moving the body at all. The lifter may not have as large a range of motion as in a normal shrug done for active flexibility. It is usually considered good form if the slope of the shoulders is horizontal in the elevated position."

To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nUnlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

To perform a parallettes push-up, assume a push-up position with your hands on the parallettes and your feet on the ground. Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nParallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nThe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

Los pies, y especialmente los dedos de los pies, deben estar bien colocados en el piso. Luego coloque los brazos superiores sobre la almohadilla que se encuentra en la parte interior del banco. La almohadilla superior debe estar ajustada en las axilas.\n\n4). Use sus brazos para agarrar la barra con las palmas hacia arriba, con un poco de ancho de hombro o un poco más cerca. Su agarre para este ejercicio será importante. Sosteniendo las manos juntas, apuntará a la cabeza externa del bíceps, mientras que cuanto más separadas estén las manos, apuntará a la cabeza interna. Puede experimentar haciendo un conjunto de rizos con un agarre más cercano y otro conjunto con un agarre más ancho para asegurarse de golpear ambas cabezas del bíceps.\n\n5). Poco a poco comience a levantar la barra hacia arriba y exhale. Asegúrese de mantener la posición contratada por un segundo y luego apriete los bíceps. Al hacer esto, desea mantener la parte superior de los brazos estacionaria y rizar el peso lo más alto posible.\n\n6). Vuelva a colocar la barra lentamente en la posición inicial y asegúrese de respirar.\n\n7). Haga una breve pausa antes de repetir la cantidad recomendada de repeticiones para su set."

Los brazos en esta ocasión, los vamos a colocar abiertos hacia los lados, y a la altura del pecho. El movimiento que vamos a hacer será una contracción hacia el pecho.

Ahora empuja las caderas tan alto como puedas, elevando el cuerpo del suelo, y prosigue empujando a través de las manos, extendiendo los codos y las rodillas, hasta que la espalda esté bien arqueada (puente lumbar). La cabeza también despega del suelo, y debe quedar a la altura de los codos, mirando hacia atrás. Esta es la posición final. El descenso debe ser lento y controlado.\nLa columna debe estar en curvatura convexa. No valen despegar la espalda del suelo, y que ésta quede recta. Debe de estar bien redondeada. Se nota además una sensación de oxigenación mayor en la espalda.\nLas caderas, tras despegarse del suelo, deben de estar bien altas, incluso por encima del nivel de la cabeza.\nLos brazos y las piernas deben permanecer rectos. Parece fácil, pero requiere de un buen nivel de flexibilidad.\nLa respiración debe ser profunda. Esta postura estira la caja torácica, y pone el diafragma bajo presión. Si la postura está bien realizada, la respiración será perfecta. Nunca hay que mantener la respiración durante el ejercicio."

    "description_html": "An archer pull-up is an advanced bodyweight exercise that strengthens your back and biceps, serving as a progression towards a one-arm pull-up. It gets its name from the \"bow-drawing\" position your body takes at the top.Here's how to do it:1. Grip: Grasp a pull-up bar with a wider-than-shoulder-width overhand grip.2. Starting Position: Hang with arms fully extended, engaging your core and keeping your shoulder blades pulled down.3. The Pull: Pull your body up towards one hand, similar to a regular pull-up. At the same time, extend the other arm out to the side, keeping it as straight as possible. Your chin should come towards the hand that is pulling.4. Hold &amp; Lower: Briefly hold the top position where one arm is bent and pulling, and the other is extended. Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position with control.5. Alternate: Repeat the movement, pulling up towards the opposite hand.The key to this exercise is to keep the assisting arm as straight as possible to maximise the load on the working arm. This makes it a challenging but effective exercise for unilateral pulling strength."

    "description_html": "Dumbbell hip thrust\nBegin seated on the ground with a bench placed horizontally behind you and your knees bent. Lay a dumbbell across your hips, holding either end with both hands. You may wish to place a pad or towel on your hips to increase comfort. With knees bent and feet firmly planted on the floor, lean back onto the bench so that it is gently pressing into your upper back. This is your starting position.\n\nInhale. Exhale. Holding onto the dumbbell, press your heels into the mat and raise your hips off the floor until your body forms one straight line from chin to knee, resting your shoulders on the bench and ensuring that your head is an extension of your spine.\n\nInhale. Lower your hips to return to the starting position but without resting your glutes on the mat. Repeat for the specified number of repetitions."

    "description_html": "It's a cardiovascular workout performed on a treadmill to improve endurance, burn calories, and promote heart health. It offers multiple benefits, such as the ability to easily adjust speed and incline, allowing for a variety of workouts, from hill walking to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and tempo runs. To optimize results, it's important to vary your workouts.\n\nBenefits of Treadmill Cardio:\n- Improved Cardiovascular Health:\nRegular aerobic exercise on a treadmill strengthens the heart and lungs, which can help prevent heart disease.\n- Weight Loss:\nBy burning calories, treadmill training can be an effective tool for weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight.\n- Muscle Strengthening:\nIt strengthens the muscles in the legs and glutes, helping to prevent muscle loss, which is especially important with age.\n- Training Flexibility:\nAllows you to vary speed, incline, and intervals, making your workout more dynamic and adaptable to different fitness levels.\n\nTypes of Treadmill Training:\n- Hill Walking:\nIncreasing the incline of the treadmill and walking at a brisk pace can improve endurance and work your leg muscles.\n- Endurance Jog:\nA run at a comfortable, steady pace that keeps your heart rate in a target zone (such as Zone 2) to build endurance.\n- Interval Training:\nAlternating periods of high intensity (fast running) with periods of low intensity (easy walking or jogging) to maximize calorie burn and cardiovascular improvement.\n- Tempo Run:\nA run at a steady, sustained pace that is slightly faster than a normal jog, which challenges your ability to sustain a more intense effort for an extended period."
